Programming 2 - Smart Campus Management System

This project consists of four main modules including a UI used for navigation between them all, the three modules include;
An equipment tracker that can be used to track how much equipment is left and allows users to change these quanities and add new ones
A student record manager where students can be added by the user and their enrolment date and grades are displayed in a table
A room booking system where a user can choose from a range of dates and times to book a certain room they choose, this features a system that stops concurrency errors by not allowing users to select times that have been saved to a file
